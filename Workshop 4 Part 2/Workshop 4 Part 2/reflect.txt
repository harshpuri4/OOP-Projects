In this week we learned about operators and their use like there are 3 type of operators Binary, unary prefix and unary postfix. In this workshop i learned how to use operators in a corrrect way because wrong use of operators can give incorrect outputs. I have used different operators in the workshop. For example - There are operators like <=, >=, == , ||, && etc. 
I have also learned about the concept of helper functions. These are used to access to the information of an object from a class through their parameters and they support a class. Overall, this workshop was also bit difficult but taught a lot of concepts.
